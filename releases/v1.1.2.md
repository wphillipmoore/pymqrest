# Release 1.1.2 (2026-02-13)

## Bug fixes

- **use PR_BUMP_TOKEN for version bump PR creation (#219)**
The version bump PR step referenced GITHUB_PR_BUMP_TOKEN, but GitHub
does not allow secrets prefixed with GITHUB_. Use PR_BUMP_TOKEN
instead, falling back to the built-in github.token if not set.

- **prevent release-gates skipped status from blocking auto-merge (#223)**
Move the pull_request condition from job-level if: to step-level if:
so the job always runs (satisfying the required check) but only
performs validation on pull_request events.
