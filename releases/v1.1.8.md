# Release 1.1.8 (2026-02-19)

## Bug fixes

- **sync shared tooling to v1.0.2**
Update sync-tooling.sh from standard-tooling v1.0.2:
- Fix --actions-compat flag leaking during self-update re-exec
- Add canonical source comment to repo-profile.sh

- **revert Python 3.10 CI matrix expansion (#323)**
Reverts commit 9c8ee2c which broke CI — the validation scripts use
tomllib (Python 3.11+) but ran under bare python3 on the 3.10 matrix.
The PR auto-merged despite failing gates, which is a separate branch
protection bug.

This reverts commit 9c8ee2cf443fb0e8495d5479645249181a25776a.

- **sync hook and lint scripts from standards-and-conventions (#324)**
* fix: sync hook and lint scripts from standards-and-conventions

Close git revert hook bypass by adding branch protection to commit-msg
hook, accept Revert commit messages, and support cross-repo issue linkage.

## CI

- **auto-add issues to GitHub Project (#319)**
* chore: add workflow to auto-add issues to GitHub Project

* chore: retrigger CI with corrected PR body


## Documentation

- **rename mq-dev-environment references to mq-rest-admin-dev-environment (#325)**
Update CI workflow, CLAUDE.md, shell scripts, developer-setup docs, and
MQ container docs to use the new repository name, aligning with the
mq-rest-admin-* naming convention.

The historical CHANGELOG.md entry is left as-is.

## Features

- **sync shared tooling from standard-tooling v1.0.0**
Replace stale local copies with canonical versions from
standard-tooling. Key changes:
- commit-messages.sh: env-var COMMIT_CUTOFF_SHA replaces hardcoded SHA
- pr-issue-linkage.sh: accepts all GitHub closing keywords
- prepare_release.py: adds ensure_develop_up_to_date() check
- Adds sync-tooling.sh and finalize_repo.sh

- **extend CI matrix to Python 3.10+ to discover minimum supported version (#322)**
Lower requires-python from >=3.12 to >=3.10, expand the CI test matrix
to cover 3.10 through 3.14, and fix ruff lint issues triggered by the
lower target version (import sorting in scripts, PERF203 in integration
tests). No library source changes required — the code supports 3.10 as-is.


## Refactoring

- **use shared docs-deploy composite action (#329)**
- **use shared composite actions for publish and release gates (#333)**
Replace inline tag/release, version bump PR, and version divergence gate logic with reusable composite actions from standard-actions.

- publish.yml: use tag-and-release and version-bump-pr actions
- ci.yml: use version-divergence action for release gates
