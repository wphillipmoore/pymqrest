## Bug fixes

- **merge main back into develop in version bump PR (#186)**
The publish workflow's version-bump PR only carried pyproject.toml and
lock files, so CHANGELOG.md and other release-branch artifacts never
reached develop. Add a git merge origin/main step before the version
bump so the single PR brings both the main-back-merge and the bump.
