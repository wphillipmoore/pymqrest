## Bug fixes

- **scope Python linters to src/ and tests/, sync standard-tooling v1.1.4 (#352)**
Exclude scripts/ from ruff to avoid conflicts with centrally managed standard-tooling scripts. Remove now-unnecessary per-file-ignores for scripts/. Sync all shared scripts from standard-tooling v1.1.4.
