# Release 1.1.0 (2026-02-12)

## Bug fixes

- **use PAT and merge strategy for version bump PR (#190)**
The bump PR created by publish.yml had two issues:

1. Pushed with GITHUB_TOKEN, which doesn't trigger CI — required
   status checks never pass and auto-merge can't complete.

2. No auto-merge was configured, requiring manual intervention.

Switch to GITHUB_PR_BUMP_TOKEN (PAT) so the push triggers CI, and
add `gh pr merge --auto --merge --delete-branch`. The --merge
strategy (not --squash) preserves the merge commit from
`git merge origin/main`, maintaining shared ancestry between main
and develop to prevent changelog conflicts on future releases.

- **skip pre-conventional commits in commit-messages lint**
The commit-messages.sh linter validates all commits in a PR range,
which fails on release PRs that include old history predating the
conventional commits convention. Add a cutoff SHA so commits at or
before the last non-conventional commit are silently skipped.

- **disable CONNAUTH/CHLAUTH and fix seed idempotency for gateway routing (#200)**
The IBM MQ container default CHLAUTH catch-all rule blocks inter-QM
channels, preventing gateway routing. Disable both CONNAUTH and CHLAUTH
on the containerized queue managers so that inter-QM sender/receiver
channels can connect. Also tolerate non-zero runmqsc exit codes in
mq_seed.sh so that re-seeding (e.g. START CHANNEL on an already-running
channel) does not fail the script. Remove redundant gateway curl
commands from mq_verify.sh since integration tests already cover those
paths.

- **remove unused provisional status labels from MAPPING_DATA (#202)**
All command entries carried a "status" field ("provisional" or
"no-equivalent") that nothing in runtime code reads. Removing it
simplifies the data structure. Test fixtures updated to use a
neutral "description" key instead.


## Documentation

- **correct platform availability claim in gateway docs (#203)**
The MQ REST API is available on all supported IBM MQ platforms
(Linux, AIX, Windows, z/OS, and IBM i), not just Linux. Updated
the gateway section to list supported platforms accurately and
note that pymqrest is developed and tested against Linux only.

- **fix sync-methods examples to use realistic object types (#207)**
SVRCONN channels are client-initiated and cannot be independently
started. Replace SVRCONN examples with multiple listeners, which is a
realistic pattern for queue managers serving different TCP ports.


## Features

- **add qmstatus and qstatus qualifier mappings (#192)**
Split DISPLAY QMSTATUS and DISPLAY QSTATUS into their own qualifiers
with full response_key_map entries, rather than sharing the qmgr and
queue qualifiers. This gives each command its own attribute namespace
for accurate mapping.

Also clean up the doc generator to only produce pages for qualifiers
that have mappings, and remove stale pages for unmapped qualifiers.

- **add mapping_overrides parameter to MQRESTSession (#194)**
Allow users to supply sparse mapping overrides at session construction
that layer on top of the built-in MAPPING_DATA via deep-copy and
key-level merge, enabling sites with existing naming conventions to
adopt pymqrest without forking.

- **add gateway_qmgr parameter to MQRESTSession (#197)**
Enable routing MQSC commands through a gateway queue manager to reach
remote queue managers on platforms without the REST API (AIX, z/OS,
Windows). When gateway_qmgr is set, the ibm-mq-rest-gateway-qmgr
header is included in every request.

- **add MappingOverrideMode.REPLACE for complete mapping replacement (#205)**
Add MappingOverrideMode enum (MERGE/REPLACE) so callers with a complete
mapping dataset can replace the built-in MAPPING_DATA entirely, with
validation that all command and qualifier keys are present.

- **add synchronous start/stop/restart wrappers for channels, listeners, and services (#206)**
MQSC START/STOP commands are fire-and-forget. These wrappers issue the
command then poll DISPLAY *STATUS until the object reaches a stable
state, providing synchronous behaviour for provisioning workflows.
