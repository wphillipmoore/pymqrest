# Release 1.1.4 (2026-02-16)

## Bug fixes

- **remove extra blank line in CHANGELOG.md**
- **disable MD041 for mkdocs snippet-include files**
The docs/site/docs/mappings/*.md files are mkdocs snippet includes
(--8<-- directives), not standalone markdown documents. MD041 (first
line must be a heading) false-positives on these. The awk structural
check in standards-compliance already enforces single-H1 for real docs.

- **correct snippets base_path resolution for fragment includes (#267)**
pymdownx.snippets resolves base_path relative to CWD (not the mkdocs.yml
location). The previous paths were relative to docs/site/ which caused
fragments to either not resolve or self-include when the wrapper file
had the same name as the fragment.

Use CWD-relative paths so fragments resolve correctly when mkdocs is
invoked from the repository root.

- **run mike from repo root so snippet base_path resolves in CI (#268)**
Remove working-directory from mike deploy step and pass
-F docs/site/mkdocs.yml instead, so CWD matches the base_path
entries in mkdocs.yml.

Ref wphillipmoore/mq-rest-admin-common#32

- **remove PR_BUMP_TOKEN and add issue linkage to version bump PR**
Remove the PR_BUMP_TOKEN secret fallback from the version bump step,
using github.token directly instead. Remove the corresponding
git remote set-url that configured token-based auth, since the
default GITHUB_TOKEN already has push access.

After creating the version bump PR, extract the PR number and edit
the body to include a self-referencing issue link (Ref #N), then
close and reopen the PR to trigger notification workflows before
enabling auto-merge.

- **rename integration-test job to integration-tests**
Standardize CI job naming across all library repos. Java already
uses integration-tests (plural); this aligns Python to match.

- **move SBOM generation after PyPI publish step (#284)**
The SBOM .cdx.json file was being written to dist/ before the PyPI
publish step, causing pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish to reject the
unknown distribution format. Move the SBOM generation after publish
but before the GitHub Release so dist/ only contains valid Python
distributions during upload to PyPI.

- **sync prepare_release.py with canonical version (#286)**
Add --issue argument for tracking issue linkage in release PR body.
Add merge_main() step to prevent CHANGELOG.md merge conflicts by
incorporating main's history before generating the changelog.


## Documentation

- **migrate from Sphinx to MkDocs Material**
Replace Sphinx+MyST+Furo with MkDocs Material to align with the Java
repo and enable shared documentation fragments via pymdownx.snippets.

- Move doc sources from docs/sphinx/ to docs/site/docs/
- Convert {doc} cross-references to standard Markdown links
- Convert eval-rst/autoclass blocks to mkdocstrings syntax
- Add mkdocs.yml with Material theme and mkdocstrings[python] plugin
- Update pyproject.toml dependencies and CI workflow
- Delete Sphinx conf.py and old docs directory

- **fix attribute names, stale auth claim, and bare pages (#251)**
- **address medium-severity documentation consistency findings (#253)**
Rewrite architecture.md to use shared fragment includes matching the Java
pattern, add transport mocking guidance, create api/transport.md, rewrite
exceptions.md with usage examples, normalize "Python names" to "Developer
names" in mapping-pipeline.md, and set dark mode as default theme palette.

- **address cross-library documentation consistency nits (#259)**
Enrich API reference pages with overviews, code examples, inline type
definitions, and structured tables to match Java/Go quality. Add code
examples to mapping pipeline page, restructure API index, standardize
nav ordering, and add architecture cross-references.

- **switch to shared fragment includes from common repo (#264)**
Replace duplicated mapping pages, AI engineering, local MQ container,
and design docs with --8<-- snippet includes from mq-rest-admin-common.
Delete generate_mapping_docs.py (moved to common).

- **add quality gates documentation page**
Include the shared quality gates fragment from mq-rest-admin-common and
append Python-specific validation pipeline details (ruff, mypy, ty,
pytest, pip-audit, uv lock check).

- **remove Python-specific design choices and beta status from rationale**
These sections are redundant with the API reference documentation and
no longer applicable.

- **update CLAUDE.md architecture section for current codebase (#276)**
Update the architecture section to reflect the current module structure:
- Mapping data now references JSON file and thin Python loader
- Add auth.py, ensure.py, sync.py, and _mapping_merge.py sections
- Add MQRESTAuthError and MQRESTTimeoutError to exceptions list


## Features

- **add Tier 1 security tooling (CodeQL, attestations, license compliance)**
- Add CodeQL SAST job to CI workflow using standard-actions composite action
- Add build provenance attestations to publish workflow (attest-build-provenance@v2)
- Add pip-licenses dependency with GPL-compatible license allowlist
- Add license compliance check to CI dependency-audit job and local validation

Ref wphillipmoore/mq-rest-admin-common#21
Ref wphillipmoore/mq-rest-admin-common#22

- **add Trivy and Semgrep CI jobs and SBOM generation**
Add Trivy filesystem vulnerability scanning and Semgrep SAST jobs to CI,
gated by docs-only detection. Add CycloneDX SBOM generation to the
publish workflow, attached to GitHub Releases alongside build artifacts.

Ref mq-rest-admin-common#11, #24, #25


## Refactoring

- **convert mapping data from Python module to JSON file (#274)**
Replace the 1956-line inline Python dict in mapping_data.py with a JSON
file loaded at import time. The JSON file is copied from the canonical
source in mq-rest-admin-common.

- Add src/pymqrest/mapping-data.json (from mq-rest-admin-common)
- Rewrite mapping_data.py to load from JSON via json.loads()
- Update generate_commands.py to use json.loads() instead of importlib
- Add mapping-data.json to pyproject.toml package-data
