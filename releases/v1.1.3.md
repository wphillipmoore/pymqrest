# Release 1.1.3 (2026-02-15)

## Bug fixes

- **add missing MAPPING_DATA entries for integration test failures (#236)**
Add missing response_key_map entries for attributes returned by the MQ
REST API: CHANNEL, CONNAME, CURRENT, XMITQ (chstatus); CHANNEL,
DEFRECON, TMPMODEL, TMPQPRFX (channel); LISTENER, TRPTYPE (listener);
NAMELIST (namelist); PROCESS (process); TYPE (qmstatus); QUEUE
(qstatus/queue); NOSHARE, NOTRIGGER, QSVCIEV, TARGET, TYPE (queue);
PUB, SUB, TOPIC (topic).

Add YES/NO to DEFPSIST response and request value maps. Add
target_queue_name to queue request_key_map. Add request_key_value_map
for listener (replace/noreplace).

Add DELETE QLOCAL, DELETE QREMOTE, DELETE QALIAS, DELETE QMODEL commands
to MAPPING_DATA. Fix lifecycle tests to use specific delete methods
instead of the generic delete_queue which sends an invalid DELETE QUEUE
MQSC command.

Fix integration tests and examples to use canonical mapped parameter
names (ha_status not status for qmstatus, start_mode not control for
listener, dead_letter_queue_name not dead_letter_q_name for qmgr,
replace "yes" not "YES", transmission_queue_name not xmit_q_name,
default_persistence not def_persistence, default_input_open_option not
default_share_option, remote_queue_manager_name not remote_q_mgr_name).

Fix namelist lifecycle test to pass names as list (MQCFSL type requires
array). Mark LTPA auth test as xfail (developer container limitation).

Regenerate commands.py (132 → 136 methods) and mapping docs.

- **allow release/* commits in library-release branching model (#244)**
The canonical pre-commit hook hard-blocked release/* as a protected
branch, but the library-release model requires committing changelog
updates on release/* during the prepare_release.py flow.


## Documentation

- **add nested object flattening design doc and queue status example (#240)**
Add a dedicated design document explaining the _flatten_nested_objects()
algorithm, edge cases, and pipeline placement. Add queue_status.py
example demonstrating DISPLAY QSTATUS TYPE(HANDLE) and DISPLAY CONN
TYPE(HANDLE) queries. Condense the inline flattening section in
runcommand-endpoint.md to cross-reference the new doc.


## Features

- **adopt per-project MQ container isolation (#233)**
Set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=pymqrest in all MQ lifecycle wrapper scripts
and pass project-name to the setup-mq CI action so multiple projects
can run integration tests simultaneously without collisions.
