# Release 1.0.2 (2026-02-11)

## Bug fixes

- **use regular merge for release PRs and refresh deps in version bump (#172)**
Release PRs (release/* → main) now use regular merge commits instead of
squash merges, eliminating history divergence between main and develop
and removing the commit-tree workaround in prepare_release.py. The
post-publish version bump PR now also runs uv lock --upgrade and
re-exports requirements files.


## Documentation

- **add pymqrest 1.0.0 GA announcement draft (#176)**
* docs: add pymqrest 1.0.0 GA announcement draft

Multi-format announcement (short, medium, micro) with channel-specific
posting guidance for Reddit, Hacker News, LinkedIn, IBM TechXchange,
Python Discourse, and Perl communities.

- **use LTPAAuth as default in examples and docs (#181)**
Switch all example scripts and documentation code samples from BasicAuth
to LTPAAuth as the recommended credential type for username/password
scenarios. Reorder auth listings to CertificateAuth, LTPAAuth, BasicAuth.
Strengthen LTPA guidance in auth docs and add TLS recommendation. Fix
Python version in README (3.14+ to 3.12+).


## Features

- **add Python 3.12 and 3.13 support (#180)**
Lower requires-python floor from 3.14 to 3.12 and add matrixed CI
testing for 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. No source changes needed — all
modules use `from __future__ import annotations` and 3.10+ syntax.

- **include changed attributes in EnsureResult (#178) (#182)**
Restructure EnsureResult from an enum into a frozen dataclass with an
EnsureAction enum for the action discriminant and a changed tuple that
surfaces which attributes triggered the ALTER command.
