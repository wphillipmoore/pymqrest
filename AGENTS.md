# Agent Instructions for pymqrest

This repository follows the shared standards and conventions located at:

- `../standards-and-conventions/`

The canonical instructions are maintained there. The content below mirrors
`../standards-and-conventions/AGENTS.md` for convenience. There are no local
overrides at this time.

# Standards and Conventions - Agent Instructions

## User Overrides (Optional)

If `~/AGENTS.md` exists and is readable, load it and apply it as a
user-specific overlay for this session. If it cannot be read, say so
briefly and continue.

This repository is the canonical source of development standards and
conventions. Treat the documents here as the default baseline for other
repositories, with local overrides captured elsewhere when needed.

## Working Rules
- Read the relevant standards before editing or adding documentation.
- Keep guidance generic; remove project-specific names, paths, or tooling.
- Preserve intent and rationale when generalizing standards.
- Update or create Tables of Contents per the Markdown standards.
- Prefer small, focused edits that keep documents easy to scan.

## Documentation First
This repo is documentation-first. Do not add code unless it is an example
explicitly required to explain a standard.

## File Layout
- Core standards live under `docs/`.
- Follow `docs/foundation/markdown-standards.md` when adding documentation.
