# AI-assisted engineering

## Transparency statement

`pymqrest` is an AI-assisted engineering project. Significant portions of
the codebase were developed collaboratively between a human engineer and
Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). This page documents what was
AI-generated, what was human-designed, and how quality was maintained.

## What was AI-generated

**Mapping data extraction**: The `MAPPING_DATA` structure in
`mapping_data.py` was extracted from IBM MQ documentation using an
AI-assisted pipeline. The extraction scripts parsed MQSC command
references to build the attribute name mappings, value mappings, and
command metadata for all 48 qualifiers.

**Command method generation**: The ~144 MQSC command wrapper methods in
`commands.py` were generated from the extracted command metadata. Each
method is a thin wrapper with the correct verb, qualifier, and return
type.

**Mapping documentation**: The 48 qualifier mapping pages in this
documentation were generated by `scripts/dev/generate_mapping_docs.py`
from the same `MAPPING_DATA` source.

**Implementation code**: Much of the session, mapping, and test code was
written through AI-assisted pair programming, with Claude proposing
implementations and the human engineer reviewing, refining, and directing
the design.

## What was human-designed

**Architecture and API design**: The overall design — single-endpoint via
`runCommandJSON`, qualifier-based mapping, method naming conventions,
return shape rules, error handling strategy — was conceived and directed
by the human engineer.

**Quality standards**: The requirement for 100% test coverage, strict
typing (mypy + ty), comprehensive linting (all ruff rules), and the
validation gate pipeline were human-defined standards.

**Design decisions**: Key choices like the mapping opt-out mechanism,
strict vs lenient modes, the transport abstraction, and the diagnostic
state interface were human decisions refined through discussion.

## Quality assurance

The AI-assisted development process maintains quality through:

**100% test coverage**: Every line and branch of production code is
covered by unit tests. Coverage is enforced as a CI hard gate.

**Strict typing**: Both mypy and ty type checkers run in strict mode
against the entire source tree.

**Comprehensive linting**: Ruff runs with all rule categories enabled.
The few per-file exceptions (like missing docstrings in generated code)
are explicitly configured.

**Validation pipeline**: `scripts/dev/validate_local.py` runs the same
checks as CI, including dependency auditing, lock file verification,
and commit message validation.

**Integration testing**: A containerized IBM MQ queue manager provides
real MQSC command validation. Integration tests verify that mapping
assumptions hold against actual MQ responses.

## The `Co-Authored-By` convention

Commits that involved AI assistance include a `Co-Authored-By` trailer:

```

This provides a transparent, auditable record of AI involvement in the
project's git history.
