## Purpose
Capture deferred work items from the current mapping runtime session so they can be resumed after the standards refresh.

## Known todos
- Replace the curated mapping source inputs with a generator that reads the extraction outputs directly.
- Expand the mapping source data beyond placeholders to cover the target qualifiers and commands.
- Add a request list mapping helper that mirrors response list behavior (including deferred error aggregation).
- Run the test suite and record any failures or adjustments needed for full coverage.
